Nextion Display Layouts by ON7LDS (for MMDVMHost)

The -L2 files in this directory are Nextion screen layouts with better
 fonts than the (rather ugly) standard Nextion fonts

There are some other changes:

* On the main screen there is a field to display the active ip address of the
  device. On Linux it is preceded with the network interface name.
* DMR: if received, the Talker Alias is decoded and displayed. The TA will be
  in green, so the user knows it is a decoded TA displaying.
  This happens on-the-fly: as the parts of the TA arrive, they will immediately
  be shown.
* If you want to change my screen layout, the only thing to keep in mind is
  that the MMDVMHost program will select following font numbers:
        default font for the TA field : font 4
        TA >16 characters             : font 3
        TA >20 characters             : font 2
        TA >24 characters             : font 1
  There always have to be at least 5 fonts, of which font 1-4 are used for the
  TA. If your display is wide enough to show all characters in one font, you
  must copy this font to the lesser ('smaller') fonts.
  i.e. : the 3.2" the display can show more than 31 characters (the maximum
  TA length) in font 2, so this font is also copied to font 1.
* If you want more control about what and how it is displayed, you better
  select Layout 3 or 4 (see README-L3)
* The screenlayout has to be selected with the parameter ScreenLayout in the
  MMDVM.ini file under the Nextion section. This way, the extra function
  to automatically change the font size, is activated.
    0 = auto (future use, for now it's G4KLX layout)
    1 = G4KLX layout
    2 = ON7LDS layout                (this README file)
    3 = ON7LDS DIY layout            (see README-L3)
    4 = ON7LDS DIY layout High Speed (see README-L3)
