The screenlayout has to be selected with the parameter ScreenLayout in the
MMDVM.ini file under the Nextion section. This way, the extra functions
are activated.
    0 = auto (future use, for now it's G4KLX layout)
    1 = G4KLX layout
    2 = ON7LDS layout                (see README-L2)
	3 = ON7LDS DIY layout            (this README file)
	4 = ON7LDS DIY layout High Speed (this README file)

screenLayout 3 and 4 are the same, but selecting 3, MMDVMHost will communicate
at 9600bps with the display and selecting 4 will set the baudrate to 115200.  
If you select 4 (115200bps) *you* have to program your Nextion to default to
that baudrate.

How to set the default Nextion Display baudrate ?
You could use the Nextion editor, connect to your display with the debug 
 tool (do not forget to select your display and not the simulator) and
 give the command 'bauds=115200'.
Another option is to set the command above in the Preinitialization Event
 of the first page. Nextion recommends to do the latter in any case,
 because 'on rare occasions bauds has become lost'


ON7LDS DIY layouts
------------------
When selecting this layout, all processing can and should be done in the 
Nextion display itself.
Whenever MMDVMHost sends new data to the screen, it also sends information
about what was sent as a number in global variable MMDVM.status.
(see further in this document for a table of numbers and their events)

Then MMDVMHost activates the Touch Press Event of object 'S0' of the 
active page.
In this event procedure, all processing can be done.

Check the Touch Press Event of object 'S0' of the DMR page of the example
HMI file. As a straightforward example, the code there will show you how
to do some tasks when receiving data from MMDVMHost or NextionDriver:
- change colors and fonts of the TA on the DMR page when it arrives.
  (TA length calculation is done in the display itself !)
- remove the slot number from t2.txt (since it's always 2)
- in the middle of the DMR screen, the previous user is displayed
  for each slot (S1 at the left, S2 at the right)
  This is done by copying the data from the ID/TA field to these
   fields at call end.

The examples are there to give you an idea of what can be done.
It is up to your imagination to go even further.
When, for example, you want to change the text 'listening' to some
other text, like 'RX', you just have to monitor the event status and 
take action in the Touch Event of S0 of the corresponding page.
Or you could hide/show pictures, switch to other pages, etc.
   
Check the NextionDriver program and the display layouts there to see
 some other examples of what can be done by programming in the 
 display. (https://github.com/on7lds/NextionDriver)


NOTE: it might be good to *not* remove fields from the display when you do not
 need them, but make them small (i.e. 10 x 10 pixels) and put them aside:
 Give them the same font color and background color as where you put them
 OR
 Put them behind some picture: put them on top of the picture, then select the 
 picture and click the 'Bring Top' button to put it on top of all those fields
 OR
 set them invisible when the page is selected (with the 'vis' command) in the 
 preinitialize event of the page

 This way, you can use the data from the fields to process them 
 as is done with the GPS data in the example.
