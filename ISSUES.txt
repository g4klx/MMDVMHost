ISSUES
======

The following issues need to be addressed in either the MMDVM firmware or the
host software.

D-Star
------
MMDVMHost does not know the status of a current reflector link when it is
(re-)started whle ircddbgateway is running. Therefore the information about
incoming reflector is missing on displays. Current workaround: Unlinking and
re-linking ircddbgateway while MMDVMHost is running.

DMR
---
Bug when receiving a data reply via the network to sent data, blocks a following
RF data trasmission.

System Fusion
-------------
Finish the VW (Voice FR Mode) AMBE FEC.
Finish the callsign extraction from the header and trailer.
