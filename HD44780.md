G0WFV's HD44780 todo list ...

As I only have a 2x16 screen at the moment, development has been done based
on this size screen.  Where it is simple, I have attempted ***but not tested***
to implement functions for larger screens.

Here's a list of things I would like to accomplish in the near future ...

- Nothing planned at this time!  Any suggestions?

## Wiring HD44780 to Raspberry Pi

The setup that is commonly used here is a 4-bit connection that is also
documented within wiringPi. The HD44780 displays have a standardized 16-pin
connector (14 pins if without backlight). The pin numbers on HD44780 refer to
this standard numbering.

The pin numbers on Raspberry Pi side are the physical pin numbers of the GPIO
pin header, in brackets the wiringPi pin number as these are referred to in the
MMDVM.ini file.

The wiring ist as follows:

```
 HD44780 pin    Raspberry Pi GPIO
  GND  1  --------   6 GND
  VCC  2  --------   2 +5V
  V0   3  --------     Trimmer between +5V and GND for contrast
  RS   4  --------  26 CE1 (11)
  RW   5  --------   6 GND
  E    6  --------  24 CE0 (10)
  D0   7
  D1   8
  D2   9
  D3  10
  D4  11  --------  11 GPIO0 (0)
  D5  12  --------  12 GPIO1 (1)
  D6  13  --------  13 GPIO2 (2)
  D7  14  --------  15 GPIO3 (3)
  GND 15  --------   6 GND
  VCC 16  --------   2 +5V
```

The relevant part in the MMDVM.ini is like outlined below.

```
[HD44780]
Rows=4
Columns=20

# For basic HD44780 displays (4-bit connection)
# rs, strb, d0, d1, d2, d3
Pins=11,10,0,1,2,3
```
